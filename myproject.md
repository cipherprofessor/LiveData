Revolutionary Idea: SkillSwap India 🔄
India's First Peer-to-Peer Skill Exchange Platform (Like Airbnb, but for Skills)

🌍 What's Working in Other Countries (NOT in India)
1. Simbi (USA) - Barter Economy for Skills

50,000+ users trading skills without money
"I'll teach you guitar, you teach me coding"
$2M funding, growing 300% YoY

2. TimeRepublik (Switzerland) - Time Banking

100,000+ users in 40 countries
Trade hours, not money: 1 hour = 1 credit
Used by corporations for team building

3. SkillShare (USA) - But paid model ($168/year)

12 million users
$200M revenue
Problem: Expensive for Indian youth

4. TaskRabbit (USA) - But focuses on physical tasks only

$50M+ revenue
Doesn't work for skill learning

NONE OF THESE EXIST IN INDIA IN A LOCALIZED, YOUTH-FRIENDLY WAY!

🎯 The Problem in India (Youth Crisis)
Shocking Reality:
83% of Indian engineering graduates are unemployable (NASSCOM report)

Know Java, but can't speak English in interviews
Great coders, but zero resume writing skills
Technical skills ✓, Soft skills ✗

60% youth earn <₹25,000/month but need expensive upskilling:

English speaking course: ₹15,000
Digital marketing: ₹30,000
Video editing: ₹20,000
Guitar lessons: ₹8,000/month
Gym trainer: ₹5,000/month

The Gap:

Engineering student knows coding → Needs English speaking
MBA student knows marketing → Needs coding basics
Designer knows Photoshop → Needs fitness training
Musician knows guitar → Needs website design

Current "Solution": Pay ₹₹₹ for courses
Problem: Most can't afford, so they stay stuck
